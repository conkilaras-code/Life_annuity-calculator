 # Life Annuity Calculator
This project implements a calculator for computing the Expected Present Value (EPV) of life annuities using mortality tables. It applies actuarial concepts such as survival probabilities, interest discounting, and time value of money.

 ## Tools & Libraries
 - Python
 - Google Colab
 - Pandas, NumPy
 - Matplotlib (for visualization)

 ## Features
 - Reads mortality/life table data
 - Calculates annuity EPVs given interest rate, payment, and start age
 - Generates survival probability curves and expected payment plots
 - Applies actuarial science concepts in a practical, coded example

 ## To Run the Project
You can run this project directly in Google Colab:

(Replace your-username with your GitHub username and update the notebook file name if needed.)

 ## Purpose
This project was built as a personal learning exercise to connect actuarial science and Python programming. It demonstrates how life tables and financial math can be combined to model real-world insurance and pension problems.
