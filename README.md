 # Life Annuity Calculator
This project creates a calculator for computing the **Expected Present Value (EPV)** of a life annuity using the SSA projected life table. It applies actuarial and financial concepts such as **time value of money**, **interest discounting**, and **survival probabilities**.

 ## Tools & Libraries
 - Python
 - Google Colab
 - Pandas, NumPy
 - Matplotlib (for visualization)

 ## Features
 - Reads life table data
 - Calculates annuity EPVs given an interest rate, yearly payment, and starting age
 - Generates survival probability curves and expected payment plots
 - Applies actuarial science concepts in a practical, coded example

 ## To Run the Project
You can run this project directly in Google Colab:

(Replace your-username with your GitHub username and update the notebook file name if needed.)

 ## Purpose
This project was built as a personal learning exercise to connect actuarial science concepts and python programming. The project shows how life tables can be combined with financial math to model real-world insurance and pension problems.
